✅ Easy to update anytime
✅ No server needed - always available!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

**Problem:** Files won't upload
- Solution: Make sure files are under 25MB each

**Problem:** Page shows README instead of app
- Solution: Make sure your main file is named exactly `index.html` (lowercase)

**Note:** The former PDF coloring books feature has been removed from the app.
 - If you see any references to coloring books in old docs or screenshots, you can ignore them.

**Problem:** Can't install as PWA
- Solution: Make sure you're using HTTPS (GitHub Pages is automatic HTTPS)
- Make sure all icon files uploaded correctly

---

## 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **Custom Domain:** You can later add your own domain (like drawingapp.com) in Settings → Pages
2. **Analytics:** Add Google Analytics to see how many people use your app
3. **Sharing:** Share the GitHub Pages URL with anyone - works instantly!
